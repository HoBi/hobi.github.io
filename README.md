*"The strongest weapon is just a simple thought"*

I am **18 years** old independent coder and programmer. I live in Ceska Lipa which is a city situated in the north of the Czech Republic. I am interested in **web technologies**, which I also study. In my free time I study languages like **HTML5**, **CSS3** with the **Sass** preprocessor, **JavaScript** with the **jQuery** library, **Dart** and **PHP**. I also use **gulp** and **Travis CI**.
